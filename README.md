# My Tech Home!

This is the code for my current dev site! It combines my portfolio and tech blog into one place. 
You can view the live site at www.lindakat.com.

Created using Nuxt and Nuxt Content! CSS styles are my own.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
