title: history

- For the past 7+ years, I was one of two customer service representatives for a custom print shop. Working alongside graphic designers and production managers, I helped customers bring their ideas to life. Working in printing involved a lot of troubleshooting, communication, and project management. I also spent a lot of time keeping track of work orders, maintaining websites built with no-code tools, and working with vendors. There was always something going on, but seeing how happy customers were with their final products was very rewarding.
- Before the print shop, I was an executive assistant for a piano store. Answering multi-line phone systems, helping the sales staff with office tasks, and greeting customers took most of my time. My favorite achievement here was creating a complete inventory database of the piano stock for all three locations. I also particularly loved being able to photograph pianos for our website.
