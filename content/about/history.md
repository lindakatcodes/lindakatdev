- Currently a software engineer apprentice at This Dot Labs! I'm working with amazing teammates to help clients achieve their goals. We get to work with a variety of technologies, which has been a wonderful experience in learning and growing as a developer. This Dot also regularly puts out content for the developer community! I couldn't have dreamed of a better place to start my dev career.
- Before This Dot, I spent 7+ years as one of two customer service representatives for a custom print shop. Working alongside graphic designers and production managers, I helped customers bring their ideas to life. Working in printing involved a lot of troubleshooting, communication, and project management. I also spent a lot of time keeping track of work orders, maintaining websites built with no-code tools, and working with vendors. There was always something going on, and seeing how happy customers were with their final products was very rewarding.
<!-- - Previously, I was an executive assistant for a piano store. Answering multi-line phone systems, helping the sales staff with office tasks, and greeting customers occupied most of my time. My favorite achievement here was creating a complete inventory database of the piano stock for all three locations. I also particularly loved being able to photograph pianos for the company website. -->
