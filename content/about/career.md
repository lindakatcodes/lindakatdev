title: career

- An open and communicative office - where asking questions is safe, feedback is constructive, and the whole human is considered.
- Working with a diverse team - a mix of viewpoints from different backgrounds and groups is vital to a company's ability to benefit others. I want to work with a variety of folks and have the chance to learn new things.
- Building a product that benefits others - I'd love to work somewhere that's focused on a specific product (though I'd be open to agency work if the company is right). I want to spend my time on something that makes someone's day easier or brighter. Bonus points if it involves music, is for other developers, or improves lives through education, healthcare or democracy!
- Currently remote due to *everything*, but I'd love to relocate to Colorado or somewhere along the West Coast!

<!-- - Building a product that benefits others - though I'm open to other options, I'd prefer to work on a product (or group of products) that provide value to others. Even value in small ways counts! I'm not looking to change the world - I just want to spend my time on something that makes someone's day a little bit easier or brighter. -->
