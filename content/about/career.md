title: career

- An open and communicative office - where everyone is free to ask questions, help each other, and accepts each other as human beings
- Colorado based, or remote
- Somewhere I can learn and grow as a developer - mentorship would be amazing, but also being able to pair program with my teammates or listen in to conversations would be amazing. I have a lot of growing to do, and I can't wait!
- Somewhere that's just plain fun to be! Folks who are friendly, kind, funny, and easy to be around. An environment where stress is left to certain moments and not an overwhelming air that hangs over every day. When problems do arise (it's impossible to avoid entirely), they are handled with respect and care for all involved.

I'm not looking to be the best - just continuously better than I am at this moment. And I'm looking for a place where I can do just that!
