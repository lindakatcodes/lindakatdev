I'm a web developer with a front end focus who loves working with JavaScript and CSS. I'm the kid who bought puzzle books for the logic puzzles, so building the logic and functionality of sites with JavaScript feels natural. I've always thrived in creative roles, and getting to add some finesse to a project with CSS is so much fun. I also value accessibility and responsive design and work hard to keep those at the forefront of my projects.

Why would you want me on your team?

- I'm empathetic and want everyone I work with to feel heard and understood.
- I'm resilient and determined to a fault when troubleshooting and finding solutions.
- I'm always looking to learn from others and share what wisdom I have in return.
- I'm an optimistic realist - I see the bright side in everything but have the experience to know when to let go or take a break.
