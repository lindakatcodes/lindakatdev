In one of the Discord groups I'm active in, we started a new weekly discussion channel. Since it's the first week, the first question was a good introduction topic. And, since I share anything more long-form here, I figured it would be good to write it out here as well.

What was this question, you ask?

> How did you get into coding/tech/etc? What's your origin story as a coder/developer/engineer? Are there things that stick out as positive memories on your journey to where you are now? And are there things you wish you could tell your past self, or things you wish you'd done differently in hindsight?

So, without further ado - my tech origin story.

Growing up, the only thing I really felt "good" at was music. I was in choir from elementary school, and once I got to junior high band started to take over and became my main thing. By senior year, I was first chair basically all year, got all the solos, and was generally the best in my instrument (flute). Everyone I loved, and everyone that knew me, knew me as being good at music.

So, when it came time for graduation, all I really had an idea about was band.
