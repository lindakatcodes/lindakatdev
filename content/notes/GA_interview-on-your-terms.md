# Interview on Your Terms

## What Makes a Good Interview?

Conversational, good flow, both parties engaged
As opposed to bad interviews, where things feel fake, intimidating, awkward

## Why common questions only go so far

What's your greatest weakness?
What is your proudest moment?
Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
Why are you the best person for this job?
Why are you a good fit for this company?
Tell about a time you worked on a team / disagreed with a coworker

## Start with your story

- can focus on accomplishments you are proud of
- leaves you more prepared for a variety of questions
- more adaptable & prepared without being rehearsed on specific questions
- stories are humanizing, conversational, friendly

## What pitfalls to avoid

- Never badmouth anyone
- surface level self reflection (what are you doing to manage that? go deeper on how you're working to improve weaknesses, especially if they sound superficial)
- focus on failure or what didn't work (what did work, what did you try to fix the issue)
- judge your own qualifications (just, only - avoid these! limiting yourself)
- don't bring things up you don't want to talk about
- don't gloss over topics you don't want to talk about (if something does come up, don't avoid talking about it at all)
- lie / embellish

## What stories to tell

- can you collaborate & work on a team?
- can you be led or mentored?
- do you learn from mistakes?
- do you self reflect?
- how do you problem solve?
- how do you handle conflict / stress?
- how do you talk about other people / companies?
- how do you talk about yourself?
- why is this the path you've taken?
- can you do this job here well?

## Story inspiration

being put into a sales position

that i can build things online - my portfolio, new app, jut building things in general

don't go to college if you don't know what you want

adjusting paths, walking away from problems & finding new solutions

every day at old job - always a fire to put out.

none

working with lisa - being able to tag team to get projects done & having someone to lean on who gets it

no one

when customers come back & say how happy they are with a finished product, or compliment me to the managers

## How to tell good stories

STARL method

- situation: describe the job & company concisely (how were you related to this problem - doesn't have to be full position)
- task: describe the problem you faced & how it affected you & others (catalyst for story)
- action: describe the process to find a solution & solution itself
- results: did it work? fail?
- learning: what did you learn?

CARL method - same as above, but situation/task combined into context

Storytelling tips:

- remember your audience
- have a thesis statement
- focus on the facts
- internal locus of control (what i did in response to situations around me)

## Tell me about yourself

experiences that have been most formative in defining yourself
can build out different stories that have made you who you are - then can break those down with CARL & use that to help provide answers later on, common threads

Elevator pitch:

- who are you as a professional right now?
- how did your past get you where you are?
- what do you love about what you do?
- what excites you about the future?

Brand statement - same questions, but longer answer / more detail

Value proposition

What value do you bring to the company specifically?

- who are you that makes you a match for this co?
- how does your past equip you for this role?
- what do you love about this role/co?
- what excites you about this role/co?

## Other tips / tricks / info

if a question makes you uncomfortable - be vague / make a joke; ask clarifying questions; "that answer won't affect my ability to do the job"

general etiquette

- take notes (don't be buried in it - but if something is interesting, call it out)
- send thank you's
- show up early (even virtually)
- have your computer plugged in
- be mindful of what will show up on your screen
- no distractions
- posture matters (lean forward a touch)
- look at photos (linkedin, website) & dress to that or slightly above
- the do-over (can include better answers to questions in thank you/follow up)

Good example questions:

- what is the greatest challenge facing this team this year?
- what is your favorite thing about working here?
- what makes you most proud to work here?
- do you have any reservations about me asa candidate for this position?
- why is this position open?
- what is your favorite mgmt style?
- how much does your team collaborate?

## Random thoughts

whatever you talk about in an interview, you should be able to own

tell your best stories, even if they're not specifically professional-based (ie lacking professional experience)

re: impostor syndrome - really narrow down on your facts

for thesis/brand - focus on why you do what you do

being able to stay on the outside of a conflict can be a skill!
