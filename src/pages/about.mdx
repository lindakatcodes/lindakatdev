<section class="about">
  I don't just write code, I craft user experiences. I have a keen eye for creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces, honed through years of photography. But my skills go beyond the aesthetic – my musical background translates to an intuitive understanding of flow, ensuring the sites I build feel smooth and effortless to navigate. It's this blend of creativity and logic that allows me to build websites that are not just functional, but truly delightful.

  My path to software engineer wasn't exactly linear. Before diving into the world of web development, I spent years in a variety of roles – print shops, piano stores, even photo labs. These experiences turned me into a communication pro. I learned how to explain complex things clearly and listen patiently. Teamwork became second nature, as I juggled projects and collaborated with all sorts of personalities. Plus, those years of juggling tasks in different roles honed my project management skills – I became an organizational whiz, keeping projects on track and ensuring all the pieces clicked into place seamlessly.
