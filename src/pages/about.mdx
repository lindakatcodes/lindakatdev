<section class="about">
  I'm a front-end software engineer with an artistic background. I'm also a career changer with top-tier communication and organization skills. I build friendly, accessible designs and modern, maintainable JavaScript logic. My mix of creativity, empathy, critical thinking, and grit helps me craft sites that are resilient, approachable, and a joy to use.

  <p class="cta">Let's build something delightful together: <a href={`mailto:${EMAIL}`} class="gradient-text">{EMAIL}</a></p>

  <ul>
    <li>I've worked in photo labs, piano stores, and print shops performing customer service and project management roles. I enjoy bringing all the pieces of a puzzle together and ensuring everyone involved is on the same page.</li>

    <li>I chose the word "compose" in my intro for a reason. I spent a decade perfecting the technique of playing flute and a few years as a lifestyle photographer. But it wasn't until I learned how to code that I could truly realize any creative idea I had. Composition is how you draw your audience in and entice them with the beauty and details of your work. I craft my websites with this same care and eye for quality.</li>

    <li>The traits I value most in a company are open communication and collaboration. I need to be able to ask questions and give and receive constructive feedback. I want to build great products that benefit humans alongside teammates that want to get better together.</li>
