<section class="about">
  I'm a front-end engineer that values user experience and accessibility. I love the web and I build with its tools - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My background in music and photography give me a sharp eye for detail and a deep sense of rhythm. I've also developed excellent communication and project management skills over my career. Together, this blend of creative and logical skills allows me to craft experiences that are a joy to use.

  <h2>My Career Journey</h2>

  The majority of my career has been in customer service and office admin roles. I've experienced diverse locations like photo labs, piano stores, and print shops. I pursued a degree in music education and spent a few years as a photographer. It's through this varied path I earned the skills and work ethic my team and managers love.

  But making the passions work removed the joy, and the other roles I fell into and found unfulfilling. I craved a career that I chose, that would need my creative and analytical sides. So I embarked on a career change and taught myself to code. I kept working full time and spent my evenings following courses and building projects. It took years of perseverance but I landed my first software engineer role in the midst of the Covid pandemic, at the age of 39. I take immense pride in this achievement. You're never too old.

  <h2>My Company Values</h2>

    <li><strong>Psychological safety</strong> - everyone feels safe to ask questions and receives constructive feedback</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-sized</strong> - teams of 5-20 developers with collaborative growth mindsets</li>

  </ul>
