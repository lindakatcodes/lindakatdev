<section class="about">
  I'm a front-end engineer that values user experience and accessibility. I love the web and I build with its tools - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My background in music and photography give me a sharp eye for detail and a deep sense of rhythm. I've also developed excellent communication and project management skills over my career. Together, this blend of creativity and logic allows me to craft experiences that are a joy to use.

  <p class="cta">Let's build something delightful together: <a href={`mailto:${EMAIL}`} class="gradient-text">{EMAIL}</a></p>

  <h2>My Background</h2>

    <figcaption>Snapshots of my past: piano recitals, marching band, my best pics from Steinway, and me with my camera.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  The majority of my career has been in customer service and office admin roles. I've worked in photo labs, piano stores, and print shops. I pursued a degree in music education and spent a few years as a photographer. It's through this varied path I earned the skills and work ethic my team and managers love.

  But making the passions work removed the joy, and the other roles I fell into and found unfulfilling. I craved a career that I chose, that would need my creative and analytical sides. So I embarked on a career change and taught myself to code. I kept working full time and spent my evenings following courses, building projects, and making new friends in the industry. It took years of perseverance but I landed my first software engineer role in the midst of the Covid pandemic, at the age of 39. I take immense pride in this achievement. You're never too old.

  <h2>What I've Made</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Boosted blogs</strong> - crafted a recommendation system with React for a popular blog to suggest relevent content after each post.</li>
      <li><strong>Featured files</strong> - developed an Angular component that lets users access route-specific PDF and MP4 files, with NgRx for data access and Cypress for testing.</li>
      <li><strong>Arcade awesomeness</strong> - gaming is my passion so I built an arcade with Astro to host mini games created in a variety of JavaScript frameworks.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>What I Want</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Open communication</strong> - everyone feels safe to ask questions and raise concerns, and receives constructive feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Career growth</strong> - manager support for career goals and teams of 5-20 developers that enjoy learning from each other.</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript based</strong> - enjoy using all the varieties, though my current favorite is Astro.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on impact</strong> - supporting a product or service that improves everyday life for others.</li>
    </ul>
