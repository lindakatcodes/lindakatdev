<section class="about">
  I'm a front-end software engineer who's all about finding the right balance. I'm a blend of all my past experiences: music, education, customer service, photography, project management. I create friendly, accessible designs and combine them with sound JavaScript logic and solid documentation. My blend of creativity and critical thinking, mixed with a big dash of empathy and grit, make me a stellar teammate and developer. 

  <p class="cta">Let's build something delightful together: <a href={`mailto:${EMAIL}`} class="gradient-text">{EMAIL}</a></p>

  <ul>
    <li>I never thought I was good at composing or being able to come up with original ideas. I played music for 15 years and I was great at technique and terrible at improv. I dabbled in photography late for 4 years and had more success with creating ideas, but it was still difficult. Turns out, I just hadn't found the right medium yet. Coding for the web has unlocked my imagination.</li>
    <li>My career up until 2020 was spent in customer service and project managment roles in various industries. I've worked in photo labs, piano stores, and print shops, and gained all sorts of random skills. But the biggest ones I earned are my ability to communicate, organize, and get things done.</li>
    <li>The things I value most in a company are open communication and collaboration. I need to be able to ask a lot of questions and give and receive constructive feedback. I want to build great products that benefit people alongside others that all want to get better.</li>
