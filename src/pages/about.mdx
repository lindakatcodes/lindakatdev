<section class="about">
  I don't just write code, I craft user experiences. I have a keen eye for creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces, honed through years of photography. But my skills go beyond the aesthetic – my musical background translates to an intuitive understanding of flow, ensuring the sites I build feel smooth and effortless to navigate. It's this blend of creativity and logic that allows me to build websites that are not just functional, but truly delightful.

  <h2>My Background</h2>

  My path to software engineer wasn't exactly linear. Before diving into the world of web development, I spent years in a variety of roles – print shops, piano stores, even photo labs. These experiences turned me into a communication pro. I learned how to explain complex things clearly and listen patiently. Teamwork became second nature, as I juggled projects and collaborated with all sorts of personalities. Plus, those years of juggling tasks in different roles honed my project management skills – I became an organizational whiz, keeping projects on track and ensuring all the pieces clicked into place seamlessly.
