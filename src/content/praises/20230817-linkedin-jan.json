    "Linda is undoubtedly one of the best engineers I've had the pleasure of working with. She always looks for ways to improve the work on a project for everyone through thorough documentation, a proactive approach, and a positive attitude. Combined with her ability to work under little guidance, she's an invaluable asset to any development team and a great senior engineer material!"
