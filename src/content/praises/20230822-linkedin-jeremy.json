  "quote": "I got the opportunity to manage Linda on multiple projects and was able to see her work first-hand. She is easily one of the most detailed and diligent developers I've ever seen. One of my favorite things about working with Linda is how she just intuitively knows all of the things that are necessary for a long-term project to be successful and is very thorough in making sure those things are in place. She will be a foundational pillar of any team that she's on and I felt blessed every time we worked together. Don't miss any opportunity that presents itself for you to work with her.",
