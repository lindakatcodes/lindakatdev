    "As a Project Manager at This Dot, I got the opportunity to manage Linda on multiple projects and was able to see her work first-hand. She is easily one of the most detailed and diligent developers I've ever seen. Not only does she consistently hit her commitments, but whenever anything comes up that could cause problems on a project she will be one of the first to speak up and communicate how the status is changing. Beyond that, she is excellent at problem-solving and putting forward recommendations on how to solve any problems that do happen to come up.",
    "One of my favorite things about working with Linda is how she frequently just intuitively knows all of the things that are necessary for a long-term project to be successful and is very thorough in making sure those things are in place, be it documentation or otherwise. She does the hard and necessary work that keeps project teams glued together and is a positive source of support and assistance for the other team members around her.",
    "She will be a foundational pillar of any team that she's on and I felt blessed every time we worked together. Don't miss any opportunity that presents itself for you to work with her."
