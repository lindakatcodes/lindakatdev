    "Linda is one of the most high-potential and high-performing I've had the pleasure of working with. Linda is a mid-level developer with the maturity, communication, organization, and leadership qualities of a high-senior developer. She craves feedback and works continuous improvement processes into her daily life (ex: tracking and reviewing her estimates vs actuals, writing formal software designs, keeping meticulous notes, etc).",
    "Linda is the type of person that isn't satisfied just being told what to do; she wants to understand why and how it all fits together. She takes this information and then writes up insightful proposals for new features and approaches for the team that would deliver real value to customers and her organization.",
    "On her team, everyone appreciates how Linda keeps the team focused on the critical work and makes sure nothing falls through the cracks. She leads by example - doing the hard work and never letting herself be lazy or cut corners. Every team is better and meets their deadlines more often when Linda is a part. Linda is also a cultural leader, willing to keep her teammates engaged with fun weekly trivia challenges and by actively participating in the conversations on Slack (we were a remote-only company).",
    "I worked with Linda on Angular, Node, Nx, React, and Gatsby projects, but I have complete confidence she'd be successful in any tech stack with the right mentoring. I unreservedly recommend Linda to anyone, and I hope to work with her again in the future whenever possible."
