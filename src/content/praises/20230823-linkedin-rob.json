  "quote": "Linda is one of the most high-potential and high-performing I've had the pleasure of working with. Linda is a mid-level developer with the maturity, communication, organization, and leadership qualities of a high-senior developer. She craves feedback and works continuous improvement processes into her daily life. She leads by example - doing the hard work and never letting herself be lazy or cut corners. Every team is better and meets their deadlines more often when Linda is a part. I unreservedly recommend Linda to anyone, and I hope to work with her again in the future whenever possible.",
