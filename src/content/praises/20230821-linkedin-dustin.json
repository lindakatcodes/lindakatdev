  "quote": "Linda adds value to every project she works on. During her tenure at This Dot, she worked on a wide variety of projects and the constant feedback I heard from her colleagues and leads was that she was invaluable to their success. Linda is a developer who can push tickets and hit deliverables, but her secret weapon is that she finds ways to go above and beyond the ask in a way that isn't costly and adds layers of value to all facets of the business. I'd absolutely hire Linda again.",
