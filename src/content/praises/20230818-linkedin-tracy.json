    "Linda has been one of the most valuable team members at This Dot. Any time a project comes up, other team members and leads request Linda to be a part of the team. This is because, not only is Linda able to pick up tickets in a sprint and work independently, but she proactively helps make any team she is on better, whether that be documenting her processes to help the onboarding of other team members, taking notes and relaying back information during critical meetings, or simply having great attention to detail when it comes to code. Linda helps all her team members think about problems that may not be obvious. While she does that, she also proposes solutions to those problems and usually they are spot on. This has been immensely valuable to products she has worked on, as well as the company."
