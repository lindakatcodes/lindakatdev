  "quote": "Any time a project comes up, other team members and leads request Linda to be a part of the team. Not only is Linda able to pick up tickets in a sprint and work independently, but she proactively helps make any team she is on better. Linda helps all her team members think about problems that may not be obvious. While she does that, she also proposes solutions to those problems and usually they are spot on. This has been immensely valuable to products she has worked on, as well as the company.",
