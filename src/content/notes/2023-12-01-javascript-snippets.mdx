### Arrays

```js
// basic reduce - adding all values in an array
arr.reduce((total, value) => total + value, 0);

// Need to know how many of each item are in an array? Reduce into an object:
var names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Tiff", "Bruce", "Alice"];

var countedNames = names.reduce(function (allNames, name) {
  if (name in allNames) {
    allNames[name]++;
  } else {
    allNames[name] = 1;
  }
  return allNames;
}, {});

// countedNames is:
// { 'Alice': 2, 'Bob': 1, 'Tiff': 1, 'Bruce': 1 }
```

### Objects

```js
// Followed the above reduce into an object, but then need to do something with the values?
// Can get all the keys, which will return an array (that you can then loop over)
Object.keys(objectName);
```

### Measuring Elements

- For total amount of space an item takes up, including visible content, padding, and border: `offsetWidth / offsetHeight`
- For amount of space the content takes up, including padding and visible content but nothing else: `clientWidth / clientHeight`
- For the total size of the content, no matter how much is visible: `scrollWidth / scrollHeight`
