### Border Radius

Can take 1-4 values, or can add a `/` and add another 1-4 values (number in px/em/rem or percentage)

Breakdown:

- 1 value: will be the same for all 4 corners
- 2 values: the first specifies top-left & bottom-right, the second is top-right & bottom-left
- 3 values: first is top-left, second is top-right & bottom-left, third is bottom-right (so splits the first value in a 2-value pair into separate values)
- 4 values: a number for each corner, in this order: top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left

**Can add a `/` to get more values!**

The values **before** the slash are for horizontal radius; values **after** the slash are vertical radius. Same value breakdown for both, but only focused on the horizontal or vertical side, depending.

```css
border-radius: 50%;
/* or */
border-radius: 20px 20px 40px 40px / 2em 3em;
```

### Text Decoration

Safari doesn't support `text-decoration-style` within the `text-decoration` shorthand. Honestly, even though it feels like you should be able to use the shorthand for the shared property and write out the others - it's best to just write them all out if you want them to look consistent. 

The shorthand across the 3 big browsers should support:

- `text-decoration-line` is underline / overline / line-through, or what type of line it is.
- `text-decoration-color` is, well, the color of the line.

The other 2 properties are:

- `text-decoration-style` is the solid / double / dotted / dashed / wavy values you can set for your decoration.
- `text-decoration-thickness` lets you set a stroke value for how thick the line is.
