Under the Play Ball title there's a dropdown to select the teams to view, then sections with red divider lines showing games for today and ones that are upcoming. Each game is listed with the two teams playing and the date and time it starts. In the today section, the game shows that it's live now with the current score."

  blurb: "For awhile I had a phone that could no longer use the official MLB app, but I still wanted to know when my favorite baseball team was playing. So I built this during a Web Dev Challenge hackathon to keep up with game times and see recent scores."
