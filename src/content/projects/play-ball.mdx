Under the Play Ball title there's a dropdown to select the teams to view, then sections with red divider lines showing games for today and ones that are upcoming. Each game is listed with the two teams playing and the date and time it starts. In the today section, the game shows that it's live now with the current score."

  blurb: "I wanted a way to see when my favorite baseball team was playing and how they'd done for their last few games without having to download an app for it or navigate a busy website. When a Web Dev Challenge hackathon came up inviting you to play with an API, I knew my time to build this tool had come!"
