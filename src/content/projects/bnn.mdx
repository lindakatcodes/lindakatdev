  blurb: "A link aggregator site initially created during Amy Dutton's Freaking Fullstack workshop. I liked the concept so much I kept implementing the design and even streamed most of my progress while doing it! It was a great way to learn some of how Redwood works and gain more practice turning a provided design into a real product."
