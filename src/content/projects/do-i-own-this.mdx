  headerImageAlt: "A heading bar with Do I Own This on the left, and a greeting and sign out button on the right. Then, a filter bar, showing a drop down menu and a text box with a search button. Finally, a link to add something new, and a grid view three across and multiple down showing photos of nail polishes with their name below them."
  description: "Do I Own This is a personal nail polish inventory tracking site. It's meant to hold information about your collection, so while you're out at a store you can easily see if you already own a polish or not. I built this site to both help my future self, and learn Vue."
