This was...not a great year for me, if I'm being honest. But there were good things in it too. And I find it helpful to review what the heck's happened to and around me  occasionally to act like I'll have some semblance of order for the future. üòâ 

TL;DR for this is: it was a year of smaller growth, stagnation, and heartbreak. I've learned myself better and am starting to notice some mind shifts happening that are going to lead to great things down the road. 

Let's dig into the good and bad things that happened and see what we can learn from them.

## The Good

The biggest life event this year was bringing Gizmo into our lives. He's completely changed our household, and it's already hard to imagine how things were without him. There's been a ton of hardship around adjusting to having a puppy and training him in the way we need him to be, but we really lucked out and got the best dog for us. He's so smart and sweet and his annoyances, while big to us, are not that terrible in the wider scheme of things.

Other fun life wins from the year:

- Got to attend a concert for my birthday with my niece, her first one (we saw one of her favs, Melanie Martinez)
- The Texas Rangers won the World Series for the first time ever!
- I think I actually made some new friends this year? I definitely had some coffee chats and great Discord convos with some awesome folks! 
- Went to an in person meetup in October to hear Janelle Shane talk about what AI can and can't do! Really interesting talk, and I actually chatted with people (including Janelle!) before and after, which is huge for me!

I also had some good career and skill advances too:

- I gave my first talk / presentation at the Women in Tech mentoring session in October!
- I studied for and passed the Contentful Partnership exam within 2 weeks
- I helped with improvements to the This Dot blog, both through articles and improving the website experience
- I created a starter.dev kit using Vue and XState, which was super fun
- I helped build a small Shopify example app that imported and exported CSV data
- I migrated my personal site from Nuxt to Astro, and started using FrontMatter as my CMS within VSCode. Also a fresh coat of paint for the styles, and a new light theme!
- I added more games to my arcade site, and made great progress on some design changes so that it can relaunch early this year
- I helped with getting Let's Chat With ready to be open sourced and wrote out the first few tickets
- I got to take and complete the Joy of React course, which was a wonderful resource
- I also used my new Contentful knowledge to finally get live previews of blog posts set up within Contentful so that editors can see what a post will look like before it's published!
- I got to write an algorithm from scratch! This was such a fun rabbit hole to go down, and I'm actually really pleased with how it turned out and the solutions I came up with. Bonus points that I got compliments from multiple developers afterwards for how well commented and organized the code is!

The best part of so many of these things is that they layer and impact each other. I was able to use the stuff I was learning in Joy of React and while studying for the Contentful exam to improve the projects and codebases I was working on, more than once. Getting the open source Let's Chat With made me figure out how to dive deep into a complex codebase and understand what's going on and find what I'm looking to fix. Working on all these problems I created a lot of architecture design docs, which gave me great talking points that I used in my presentation on documenting your progress. It all feeds into each other, and it's really nice when you can directly see how.

## The Bad 

Like most people, I have some general gripes about the year:

- Adjusting to our first dog, and a puppy no less, has been *a lot* and has caused more than it's share of disagreements and tense moments in the house. We're reaching a good point here thank goodness, but to act like it wasn't rough wouldn't be the truth.
- I knew I felt stuck in my current role earlier this year, and I didn't know enough to know what to do about it. I was looking too much outward, hoping others would be better able to guide me because I sure don't know what the heck I'm doing most of the time. lol But that wasn't fruitful, or fair to anyone else. It's ok and normal to be curious how others do things and what their "secrets" are for success, but at some point you have to handle it for yourself, and I didn't.

But I got hit hard 4 times this year:

- End of January / early February, my partner's dad passed away
- Early June, my stepmom passed away
- End of June, we had to make the choice of rehoming one of the two puppies we got because we just couldn't properly handle two
- Mid August, I got laid off from my first (and best) tech job

It just didn't stop this year, and I don't think I realized for a very long time just how badly it all affected me. Any one of these situations would be emotionally draining for lots of people, and I dealt with one every few months this year. It's no wonder I've been striving so hard just to have some calm in each day. 

## The Lessons

So, what can I use from this year? Of these big bads and so many decent wins, what can I learn? 

- Allow yourself to grieve, even if it feels weird. It's ok to be hurt by the things that hurt you.
- Don't forget that you still made big strides in your learning and experience this year, and that will pay off for you.
- You're still standing and trying to move forward after all of this. You're a badass. 
- Keep prioritizing the monthly mentoring sessions. Those have been so good for your soul and your network - that's a space where you belong.
- You can do hard things, if you can just push through the hard parts. Your natural patience and resilience is your biggest strength here. Keep using them.
- You know more than you think. You can trust your gut more, and lean into action more.
- Keep making time for learning new things. Write code just to play with it, follow courses, read blogs, watch streams. Don't lose that.
- The things you want to do mean you have to get used to being observed, and not be afraid to be yourself around strangers. I know there's lots of reasons this is a big deal for you, but it's time. I believe in you. 

I don't know what this is going to mean as far as goals for next year, or if I even want to do that. That's for another day's me to deal with. üòÅ So many of the things I want for myself are big, abstract, long-term ideas and it's hard to pin those down without feeling bad that I inevitably don't reach them. Those kind of goals don't serve me. So I need to think more about how to keep putting some of these lessons to work for me.

## Final Thoughts

My word for 2023 was meant to be "build". I'd spent the previous two years reminding myself to "have grit" and "manifest your dreams", and I'd actually finally made it happen. I wanted to build on top of that, start turning my luck into an actual foundation that can support me going forward. I don't think the year turned out that way for me. 

It's nice to remember that I didn't completely lose the year - I did still gain knowledge and experience on projects I'm happy to have been a part of, and I did actually make new friends. But I'm actually tired of dreaming big. I want to focus on my inner self, and put habits and systems into place that help me do what I do to the best of my abilities. I want those long term dreams to actually be a thing I can live. 

I'm thinking through how I want to consider goals for myself. The way I've been doing it hasn't really ever worked for me on purpose. It mostly just makes me feel bad and stop trying at anything. So I've got some brain re-wiring to do. If I find something that works for me, I'll be sure to let y'all know!
