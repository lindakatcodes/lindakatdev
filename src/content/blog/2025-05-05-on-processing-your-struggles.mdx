If I can be sad on main for a min:

It SUCKS knowing how badly my layoff (1 3/4 years ago now) has completely tanked my belief in myself. I'm still dealing and processing, and I hate how long it's taking me.

I finally found a thing I felt good at and liked myself doing. I took a leap in 2020 and went full time job search mode. Took over a year, but I landed somewhere. I made a career switch to something I actually wanted to do for work.

And I landed somewhere amazing.

A place where personal growth mattered and was invested in. Where folks loved my way of thinking and constantly gave me praise for my progress and how I helped the team. Where I felt important, valued.

I did the thing that felt impossible for 2 years. And then it was taken away from me.

And it wasn't because I was doing poorly. It was business. The signs were there. But I let myself not worry much because I was still getting great feedback on my work, what there was of it. And I wasn't the only one let go, so I know it wasn't me.

But it also WAS me. I didn't fit enough anymore.

I still got glowing recommendations. I still cry when I read them, knowing these smart, kind people thought of me that way.

But now I'm stuck, back at square zero, and can't make progress for the life of me. I can't seem to process that this "once in a lifetime" situation is gone.

The worst part is, I still believe in myself. No way is this the end of me. I did it once, I can do it again.

But I'm different now. The world is different now too. And I'm struggling to find my footing so I can do the thing again as work.

It's wild to have so much self confidence, and none of it at the same time. lol To believe that things will work out for me again at some point, and also not know who I am anymore or how to find myself again. The great paradox.

This is what's holding me back. Letting go and finding myself again.

Streaming has actually been a big help for some of this. Coding in general still gives me the biggest self confidence boost, and sharing it, even with just 1 person, adds to it. And since it's my stream it's always my decision what I do and what I accept. It works for me.

I just also know I'm not enough of a "personality" to make it big, which I'm fine with. All I really want is my own small share in a community. I've never wanted to be the face of something, always happier behind the scenes as long as my work is appreciated and acknowledged.

I'm also learning more about my own neurodivergence, which I'd never really considered before. But now watching most ND-related videos makes me tear up from feeling seen. So learning how to accept this about myself and navigate knowing this has been a lot of the struggle too.

It's made so many things clearer for me, but also means I'm losing my ability to mask which is making job searching harder. So many things I've done in life were done by just forcing myself because "I had to", not seeing how much I was actually hiding away inside my body.

I can't force myself to do things anymore. I know too much now. lol So trying to figure out what moving forward even looks like for me, how I can do the things I know I need to do for myself without having to force it, is tough.

Trying to be patient with myself, but I'm also losing patience.

I'm sharing in case someone else needs to know that you're not alone in feeling like you take 10 years to do things everyone else seems to do in weeks. You still deserve the effort you can give. You deserve love and good things. It's ok if it's hard. It's enough. YOU'RE enough.
